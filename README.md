# Desafio Latam: React II Module Test

In this challenge, an application is created with React for the pizzeria Mamma Mia. React Router is used as the application routing manager and global state is handled with Context API.

In the application there are 3 views:
- Home (/): Shows the pizza catalog, from there you can add pizzas to the cart and access the detail of each pizza.
- PizzaDetail (pizzas/:id) : Detailed view of each pizza, from here you can also add a product and return to the main catalog.
- Cart (/carrito): Shows the detail of the purchase, value and quantity, allows to increase or decrease the quantity of each product, and displays the total.
